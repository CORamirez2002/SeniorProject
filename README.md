## Project Goal
Our aim is to implement a neural network to detect anomalous waveforms on an embedded system (Xilinx FPGA platform)

### Datasets
#### RC circuit dataset
Oscilloscope data from a simple RC circuit built on a breadboard. Acceptable values set at ??Ohms and ??Farads. Dataset divided into three folders:  
- Training data (Good)
- Training data (Bad)
- Test data (Mixed)

Limited in applicability and difficulty. Obsolete.
#### Radar Dataset
This is our current selection. Dataset to be generated digitally with filters and noise as appropriate amongst three categories:
- Regular radar signals
- ????
- ????
